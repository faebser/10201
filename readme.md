# Contribution guide for giulia

Okay giulia, are you ready? This is going to hurt a bit :)

## setting up github desktop and check out repo

* first install github desktop from https://desktop.github.com/
* then go to the [repository](https://github.com/faebser/10201)
* and check it out with the github software
* now the code is on your harddisk and ready to edit it BUT

## setting up your computer for php/scss

* Open a terminal window
* type in ```php -v``` if should show something like this:
```bash
PHP 7.1.2 (cli) (built: Feb 14 2017 21:24:49) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies
```
* if the output is something like ```command not found``` you need to install PHP (maybe ask your roommate ;) )
* Now inside of the terminal window use the ```cd``` command to change into the directory of the repository. like ```cd /home/giulia/git/10201```
* In the directory run ```php -S localhost:8000``` to start the PHP development server
* switch to your browser and type ```localhost:8000``` into the address bar
* if it show the muda homepage you were successfull otherwise not ;)
