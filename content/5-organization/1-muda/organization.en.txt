Description: 

The Museum of Digital Art is Europe's first physical and virtual museum dedicated to digital arts — an open space connecting creativity and technology.                            

Located in Zurich West — a hot spot for science, technology and art — the MuDA aims to inspire and delight its audience with playful and poetic digital art installations run by 0s and 1s, but also serves as a platform to discuss and explore the intricate relationships between data, algorithms and society.                             
The Museum of Digital Art is a project initiated by the Digital Arts Association (DAA), a non-profit organisation.
